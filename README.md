# Website-Corporate-IT-1
This website is a student project for the course "Corporate-IT-1" at the Vienna University of Economics and Business.

The goal of this project is to implement a website that offers a novel, unique, and innovative service to help respond to issues that arise due to the increased feelings of loneliness during social isolation.
